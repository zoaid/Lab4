<h2><a id = "CSS"></a> CSS</h2>
<p>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheet, which means flowing style sheets, and CSS technology is used in designing web pages so that the entire look of the site is controlled in terms of the type, color,
 or size of the font used, without the need to write those codes or repeat them in Each page within the site, and therefore it is possible to make any modifications to all files through only one file,
 which saves a lot of effort and time. The function of this technology is to control how the web page is displayed without interfering with the content, 
which facilitates the process of managing the site, modifying a single CSS file will affect the design of all website pages.
 CSS files simplify the design and management of sites, and solve many problems that any website developer may face
 for example if you have designed your site using HTML, and assuming that this site consists of five pages, then you want after 
 a while Developing and modifying the way this site is displayed ... Here you have to redesign the five pages again,
 this is very easy and you have to start now. Assuming that this site contains a greater number of pages, and let it be 50 or 100 pages, 
 it is sure that you will Hesitate before embarking on the development and modification ... 
 But if you have designed your site from the beginning using CSS technology, then all you have to do is modify one file only.
